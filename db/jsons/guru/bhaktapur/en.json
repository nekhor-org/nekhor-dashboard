There were countless shrines everywhere, sacred to the region’s clans. Khandro Yeshé Tsogyal, a woman of foreign looks and manners, yet a lady of magnificent bearing, once wandered these lanes. Indeed, her radiance left the locals speechless and in awe. It was here that another foreigner, a young Indian boy named Arya Salé, strolled up to Yeshé Tsogyal, giving birth to a relationship that would lead to vast benefits and spiritual accomplishments––first in Nepal and later in Tibet, Land of Snows.","link_content_1":"","title_2":"HOW TO GET THERE","content_2":"Bhaktapur lies in the southeastern corner of the valley.

Today, Bhaktapur is known for its rich culture and temples, and its craftsmanship and artistry in wood, metal, and stone. Its many squares often feature reservoirs of water and are surrounded by temples. Unlike the people of Patan, the devout in Bhaktapur are mostly Hindu. Nevertheless, the city is home to several important Buddhist temples and monasteries. ","link_content_4":"","content_5":"Most Buddhist pilgrims visit Prashannashil Mahavihara, which enshrines a beautiful statue of Dipamkara, sometimes known as Red Tara. It is found just north of Dattatraya Square, which is named for the magnificent Dattaraya Temple, where there are statues of the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Since the precise location of the encounter between Khandro Yeshé Tsogyal and Arya Salé remains unknown, we can imagine the whole of Bhaktapur as the setting for their meeting.
